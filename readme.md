First project - Development of a Dodge game.

Game logic:
There are 10 baddies that try to catch you. Your goal is to dodge them.
If they collide into each another - one disappears and the number of baddies decrease.
If one of them collides into you - you lose.
If there's only one baddie left in the game, you win.
The goal is to survive long enough and lead the baddies to collide into each other. 
In the process you can collect some coins.
